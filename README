Hi! Thanks for taking time to actually read this.

This is my game for Ludum Dare 22 called Sat-E. It's a game about a lonely satellite in space who wants to find, or build, a friend for himself.

# Gameplay
Move around and collect junk and other items. Avoid asteroids and you must return back home before the battery runs out.
Buy stuff with the things you collect. Your goal is to buy the friend and thus win the game!
