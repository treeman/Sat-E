# Story
A lone satellite astray in space. Did you ever see Wall-E? Well this is something similar. (Need a cool name there! Sat-E? xD).
He wants to collect things, might want to get some trading/crafting/building in somewhere? Possibly a treasure chest or something and he only switches items worth as much or something? Kind of eccentric.
Should never meet anything else he can talk to!
Will want to collect an X number of stuff I think? Because... Hmm... So he can become the richest satellite in space?
